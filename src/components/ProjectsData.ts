    description: "Taskingo is my first full-scale project, created with a focus on user utility. As it is my initial venture, it appears more raw compared to the rest of the projects in my portfolio. Taskingo is primarily designed for self-organization. Users can create their own boards to manage lists and tasks within. Personally, I use Taskingo almost daily to better organize activities such as shopping with my partner. A few clicks, and our shopping trip is cut in half when I check the integrity of my Taskingo list with my shopping cart. Building this application in a short time after starting to learn React posed several challenges, but ultimately, the functionality was preserved, and I can now enjoy my own hosted task manager. Worth to mention; the application is responsive on mobile devices, utilizes Supabase as a database, and is developed using React TS.",

    description: "Tibia Helper is my first project where I relied entirely on an API to provide data for the project. After completing Taskingo, I pondered where to challenge myself next. I opted for a project based on an API. During the development of this project, I didn't encounter many issues since I already had a good understanding of React and had worked with fetching and displaying individual APIs in the past. The main advantage of this application is that virtually anyone can use Tibia Helper to check basic, up-to-date information about the world of this MMORPG game. The easy and user-friendly design of the website allows users to enjoy a visually appealing experience while seamlessly navigating through the pages to find the information they seek. Worth to mention; the application is responsive on mobile devices and is developed using React TS.",

    description: 'Cysia Candles marks my initial foray into the realm of an "online store." Creating an e-commerce platform for candles based on products occasionally sold to friends by my partner I have introduced many new features, such as a language changer and theme switcher. Ultimately, I am fully satisfied with the achieved result. In practice, the entire application is built on the resemblance to an average online store. However, in Cysia Candles, users, for better or worse, cannot make online payments for the ordered products. It serves more as a showcase to test whether I can independently create a mini online store. Worth to mention; the app saves the cart and the other information through local storage, is fully responsive on mobile devices and is developed using React TS.',

    description: "Since I began learning JavaScript, right from the start of this adventure, I encountered beginner-friendly projects of mini-games like blackjack or tic-tac-toe. Early on, I knew I wanted to try building a mini-clone of my favorite web-based game, Cookie Clicker by Orteil. I sourced practically all the graphics from the official game's wiki, while designing the functionality independently. I have no idea if the original Cookie Clicker operates in the same way, but mine does, and it functions correctly. In the end, I am pleased with this project. In this project, I simulated the options system for the first time and implemented sounds for the first time. Although I would recommend everyone play the official Cookie Clicker, this application could serve as a kind of pre-alpha version for a similar idle clicker. Worth to mention; the app isn't responsive with mobile devices and is developed using React TS.",
