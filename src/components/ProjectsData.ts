    description: "Taskingo is my first full-scale project, created with a focus on user utility. Fun fact is, I've created this app thrice already. First time while learning react, second time when mastering my ts skills written in vanilla ts, and third time written when practicing next.js, improving the app every time I refactored the code. Taskingo is primarily designed for self-organisation, allowing users to create their own boards, manage lists and tasks within. Personally, I use Taskingo almost daily to better organize activities such as shopping or home tasks. The final version which I host is written in next.js, utilizing supabase auth and database and is responvive on mobile devices.",

    description: "Tibia Helper is my first project where I relied entirely on an API to provide data for the project. After completing Taskingo, I pondered where to challenge myself next. I opted for a project based on an API. During the development of this project, I didn't encounter many issues since I already had a good understanding of React and had worked with fetching and displaying individual APIs in the past. The main advantage of this application is that virtually anyone can use Tibia Helper to check basic, up-to-date information about the world of this MMORPG game. The easy and user-friendly design of the website allows users to enjoy a visually appealing experience while seamlessly navigating through the pages to find the information they seek. Worth to mention; the application is responsive on mobile devices and is developed using React TS.",

    description: 'Cysia Candles marks my initial foray into the realm of an "online store." Creating an e-commerce platform for candles based on products occasionally sold to friends by my partner I have introduced many new features, such as a language changer and theme switcher. Ultimately, I am fully satisfied with the achieved result. In practice, the entire application is built on the resemblance to an average online store. However, in Cysia Candles, users, for better or worse, cannot make online payments for the ordered products. It serves more as a showcase to test whether I can independently create a mini online store. Worth to mention; the app saves the cart and the other information through local storage, is fully responsive on mobile devices and is developed using React TS.',

    description: "Since I began learning JavaScript, right from the start of this adventure, I encountered beginner-friendly projects of mini-games like blackjack or tic-tac-toe. Early on, I knew I wanted to try building a mini-clone of my favorite web-based game, Cookie Clicker by Orteil. I sourced practically all the graphics from the official game's wiki, while designing the functionality independently. I have no idea if the original Cookie Clicker operates in the same way, but mine does, and it functions correctly. In the end, I am pleased with this project. In this project, I simulated the options system for the first time and implemented sounds for the first time. Although I would recommend everyone play the official Cookie Clicker, this application could serve as a kind of pre-alpha version for a similar idle clicker. Worth to mention; the app isn't responsive with mobile devices and is developed using React TS.",

    description: "ThreadNest is my first project that integrates a separately built Next.js frontend hosted on Vercel with an Express.js backend utilizing Mongoose and MongoDB for database management. The project was created to test my skills in full-stack development, and I found myself thoroughly enjoying the challenge of handling both sides of the application when necessary. I began by developing the backend, but the real challenge emerged when I started working on the frontend. I quickly realized how many adjustments were required on the backend to meet the needs of the frontend. Despite these challenges, the process was immensely enjoyable. There are still areas for improvement, but I was keen to implement my own authentication system using JWT tokens. On the frontend, I employed Shadcn for most of the CSS, and I rigorously tested the backend in a local environment using Postman for manual testing and Chai/Supertest for automated tests. I am proud of this accomplishment and excited to tackle even more complex projects in the future.",

    description: "SPS Iskra is my first full-scale freelance project, utilizing a combination of Next.js and Supabase for data storage and graphics used by the company. In this project, I participated both as a developer and as a designer, working with the client from scratch to design and style the website to meet their needs. It wasn't an easy task, but the client was satisfied, and I learned a lot from the experience. Unfortunately, the project had to be completed in a very short timeframe, which left room for some minor noticable imperfections. Despite this, I am pleased with the outcome of the collaboration. Importantly, the client was provided with an administrative panel that allows for adding new users with optional roles, creating and modifying content on the site, and managing the flow of information. Worth to mention; the app is fully responsive on mobile devices and is developed using Next.js.",
